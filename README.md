The TSP is a problem that asks for the most efficient trajectory possible given a set of points and distances that must all be visited. The application contains 4 algorithms that is able to provide users with a visual representation on how the algorithms traverse through the nodes to find the optimal route. Additionally, the application is also able display the time taken and results.
